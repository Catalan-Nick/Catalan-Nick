# Hello There 
I'm Nicholas Catalan, I'm new to the web development field but I am highly driven. I have found my passion in creating and implementing sites. By mixing traditional classroom learning and self-taught course work, Iâ€™ve quickly acquired a wide array of knowledge and going forward Iâ€™m willing to learn any new skill I need.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on backend development

### My git hub repos are currently work in progress
There'll be an organized list of my projects here in 3 categories: simple, intermediate, and Capstones.

## Simple
Using no frameworks, these websites are made with only HTML, CSS, and Javascript
- Clocks: A website for telling time, with two sliding buttons for changing mode and format.

## Intermediate
Programs with a greater amount of code, serveral of them showcase the use of different frameworks.
- Tunic: A Bootstrap framed responsive website, featuring a shifting text box, carosel of images with controls, sliding sections with pop-up modules.
- Movie_Browser: React framed website for seaching movies. API integration from [The Movie DataBase](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en-US)
